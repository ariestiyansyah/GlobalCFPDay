### Code you can hold: Making your first IoT wearable

by Charlyn Gonda, Uber

Modern microcontrollers make it easy to bring your code out of the digital world and into the physical. Learn how any software engineer can get started with microcontroller programming, beginning with the Particle Photon board, a wifi-enabled microcontroller. You already know how to code. Now you just need a basic understanding of circuits and familiarity with the latest tools. Let’s pick up our soldering irons and put on safety goggles—it’s time to make things.

## Seven things you won't believe Atom can do: editor tools, efficiency, and the psychology of making habits stick

by Tilde Ann, Github

Developer tools can be an efficiency multiplier, but tools only help when you actually use them. It's also tough to balance time between "learning to use your tools better" and "getting things done." Get an introduction to the psychology of making habits stick and hear about some lesser-known yet powerful features of Atom, the hackable text editor. From real-time collaborative text editing to built-in Git integration, there's a lot you might not know your editor can do.

## Long Example

### Leveling up WebAssembly itself: Going from MVP to brave new world

by Lin Clark, Mozilla

What if your "Hello World" project could have an impact on the real world? What if your first code could control a structure like the ARCH?

Sponsored by Mozilla for close to 2,000 attendees at GitHub Universe 2018, the ARCH Light Art Installation is the first truly immersive "code expressed into art" experience. Anyone can contribute to this interactive, multi-sensory installation—the first of its kind to visualize the power of JavaScript and WebAssembly as animation with over 30,000 colored LEDs.

In this talk, we’ll start with the narrative of collaboration with experiential artist Ian Brill who created the ARCH piece and progress into how code can express 3D Space (perhaps 4D if you include time) in computing power. Then we’ll dive into why this structure is a good mental model for how WebAssembly and JavaScript work together through something called linear memory.
