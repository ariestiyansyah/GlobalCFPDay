### Code you can hold: Making your first IoT wearable
by Charlyn Gonda, Uber

Modern microcontrollers make it easy to bring your code out of the digital world and into the physical. Learn how any software engineer can get started with microcontroller programming, beginning with the Particle Photon board, a wifi-enabled microcontroller. You already know how to code. Now you just need a basic understanding of circuits and familiarity with the latest tools. Let’s pick up our soldering irons and put on safety goggles—it’s time to make things.

## Seven things you won't believe Atom can do: editor tools, efficiency, and the psychology of making habits stick
by Tilde Ann, Github

Developer tools can be an efficiency multiplier, but tools only help when you actually use them. It's also tough to balance time between "learning to use your tools better" and "getting things done." Get an introduction to the psychology of making habits stick and hear about some lesser-known yet powerful features of Atom, the hackable text editor. From real-time collaborative text editing to built-in Git integration, there's a lot you might not know your editor can do.

### Demystifying the Patch Function
by Lisa Roah, Facebook

One of the most challenging and important thing fors for Python developers learn is the unittest mock library. The patch function is in particular confusing- there are many different ways to use it. Should I use a context manager? Decorator? When would I use it manually? Improperly used patch functions can make unit tests useless, all the while making them look as if they are correctly testing code.Let’s learn how to wield patch with confidence!

### Leveling up WebAssembly itself: Going from MVP to brave new world
by Lin Clark, Mozilla

What if your "Hello World" project could have an impact on the real world? What if your first code could control a structure like the ARCH?

Sponsored by Mozilla for close to 2,000 attendees at GitHub Universe 2018, the ARCH Light Art Installation is the first truly immersive "code expressed into art" experience. Anyone can contribute to this interactive, multi-sensory installation—the first of its kind to visualize the power of JavaScript and WebAssembly as animation with over 30,000 colored LEDs.

In this talk, we’ll start with the narrative of collaboration with experiential artist Ian Brill who created the ARCH piece and progress into how code can express 3D Space (perhaps 4D if you include time) in computing power. Then we’ll dive into why this structure is a good mental model for how WebAssembly and JavaScript work together through something called linear memory.

### Elegant Solutions For Everyday Python Problems
by Nina Zakharenko, Venmo

Are you an intermediate python developer looking to level up? Luckily, python provides us with a unique set of tools to make our code more elegant and readable by providing language features that make your code more intuitive and cut down on repetition. In this talk, I’ll share practical pythonic solutions for supercharging your code.

Specifically, I'll cover:

- What magic methods are, and show you how to use them in your own code.
- When and how to use partial methods.
- An explanation of ContextManagers and Decorators, as well as multiple techniques for implementing them.
- How to effectively use NamedTuples, and even subclass and extend them!

Lastly, I'll go over some example code that ties many of these techniques together in a cohesive way. You'll leave this talk feeling confident about using these tools and techniques in your next python project!

### Dataclasses: The code generator to end all code generators
by Raymond Hettinger, Mutable Minds

The PEP 557 dataclasses module is available in starting in Python 3.7. It will become an essential part of every Python programmer's toolkit. This talk shows what problem the module solves, explains its key design decisions, and provides practical examples of how to put it to work.

Dataclasses are shown to be the next step in a progression of data aggregation tools: tuple, dict, simple class, bunch recipe, named tuples, records, attrs, and then dataclasses. Each builds upon the one that came before, adding expressiveness at the expense of complexity.

Dataclasses are unique in that they let you selectively turn-on or turn-off its various capabilities and it lets the user choose the underlying data store (either instance dictionary, instance slots, or an inherited base class).

Dataclasses and typing.NamedTuple both use variable annotations which were new in Python 3.6.
